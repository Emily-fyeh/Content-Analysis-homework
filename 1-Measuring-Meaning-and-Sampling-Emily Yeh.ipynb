What is the social game, social work, or social actors about whom you are seeking to make inferences? What are the virtues of your proposed sample with respect to your research questions?

    "My proposed topic is to measure Taiwanese Nationalism on Twitter. Since Twitter is the main realm of international propaganda for Taiwanese identity, retweets under the posts of the political opinion leaders can represent the bipolarity of pro/against independence voices. Through retrieving the Tweets relevant Taipei-Beijing tension, it is possible to quantify and analyze the fluctuation of the \"imagined community\" of Taiwanese people. In this social game of conveying the legitimacy of “Taiwan as a state”,  the wordings and expressions of the unorganized, self-motivated group of netizens have shown the aggregate (yet possibly diversified) “Taiwanese” image to the English world.

    "To comment about Taiwan’s status on Twitter requires strong incentives from the actors, since Twitter is not the main social media website in Taiwan, but rather an outreaching channel; they are possibly mobilized by certain international incidents, believing that they can play a part in the game fighting for the Taiwanese narrative. Tweets of Tsai Ing-wen, Lijian Zhao, and Hua Chunying become the frontlines of the pro/anti-PRC battlefield, the sharp confrontation between the two propagandas can also create echo chambers boosting inner confidence. To clearly capture the ideologies within the short contents, the inferences should be carefully made to avoid biases. The international voices from global powers and leading media would also affect the narratives by adding multiple issue frameworks to the cross-strait relationship: such as democracy backsliding, human rights protection, pandemic governance, and trade disputes. Thus, studying the contents of the third-party actors can provide a more comprehensive understanding of online ideological warfare."
